    <p>Slate is an up-and-coming roaster that also operates a single retail location. While they haven't been in business as long as Tony's, they appeal to younger and up-and-coming coffee connoisseurs. In other words... hipsters.</p>
    
    <p>Despite the negative connotations this connection might conjure, their coffee is quite good - although impressively over-priced. The shop is tucked away on a fairly non-descript corner of Market Street, although it's right across the street from a very swanky new farm-to-table restaurant.</p>
    
    <p>Of the two, Slate is probably better-positioned to capitalize on the active, coffee-going public - that is, young people who like to go hang out at coffee shops. The space it occupies is well-designed, embodying the sleek/modern yet semi-Bohemian/funky, eccentric aesthetic that seems to be so popular in Seattle's trendier neighborhoods.</p>
    
    <p>Slate's most distinguishing characteristic is that it attempts to blend a hip coffee shop with the craft cocktail bar concept. While this is almost a slam-dunk recipe for success, it creates an environment that is certainly not for everyone. For one thing, it produces wait times that can be painfully long; for another, the prices reflect the commitment to the craft bar experience.</p>
